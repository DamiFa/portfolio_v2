                <p class="to-fill">I took this job as a <strong>challenge for myself</strong>. I started learning web development and wanted to work on a project with <strong>real constraints</strong>, not just something I do for myself but a <strong>product for a client</strong>, answering his needs with all the problematics that come with.</p>
                <p class="to-fill">It was a segemented 3 months project. I started working on the design and had to wait for the owner’s approval. Having difficulties with the restaurant’s oppening we had to postpone the website’s development for a few months. The programming part took a few weeks, it was a side project during the development of Bokida.</p>

                <p class="to-fill">The graphical charter having been done by my sister previously, I already had the branding and the logo. I have been able to concentrate on the <strong>UX</strong>. I used Adobe Illustrator to create my wireframes and mockups.</p>
                <h4 class="to-fill">Visitor Side</h4>
                <p class="to-fill">My goal was to create a <strong>one page web site</strong> with everything available easily and a clean look. My biggest constraints were my technical skills. I used a simple layout with tabs organized by section. The most important part was the « Menu » section where the user could find the lunch formula, the dishes, suggestions and the wines. Each of thoses sub-sections have a different layout.</p>
                <h4 class="to-fill">Admin Side</h4>
                <p class="to-fill">Concerning the admin side I mostly needed to do something <strong>functional</strong> and easy to use as it would only be used by the owner and the cook. They needed to be able to update the lunch formula, the dishes and the suggestions.</p>

                <p class="to-fill">I used <strong>Bootstrap</strong> as a base for the CSS and did everything else from scratch (cf. What I Would Do Differently).</p>
                <p class="to-fill">I wrote everything in <strong>HTML and JS</strong> except for my API that I wrote in <strong>PHP</strong> which was, at the time, the only server side language I knew. The database was in <strong>mySQL</strong>, the most convienent for the task.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-7">
                <p class="to-fill">It was a good training and a <strong>formative</strong> way to apply the theory I learned prior to this project. Before it, I just had done some exercises but never had developed a full website. As a beginner I fell in most beginners traps such as web browers compatibility, special characters in SQL requests, character encoding and more. Those are types of mistakes that I am now able to <strong>anticipate and identify</strong>.</p>    
                <p class="to-fill">My favorite part of the website is the admin side as it is where there are the most <strong>interactions</strong>. I tried to make it as usable as my programming skills allowed. Adding feedbacks when updating content, automatically filling text fields from the database, instantly adding or deleting text fields. I also created a delayed update that allowed the client to update his menu at a later date. Sadly I was not able to implement it as the client’s server did not allow « on schedule » requests.</p>   
                <p class="to-fill">A challenging part of the project was the <strong>communication with the client</strong>. It was not always easy to get a clear answer and find exactly what he wanted (not being sure himself). To ease the communication I tried to explain my design choices with anotated mock ups and made several suggestions for each iteration.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-7">
                <p class="to-fill">I would use a <strong>library to simplify server requests and compatibility issues</strong> such as jQuery or Axios. I really enjoy coding with JS and since then I learned more JS tools (Node, React, Express, ...) and <strong>still learning</strong>.</p>    
                <p class="to-fill">On the design side I would now go for a bolder design while keeping the <strong>clean and simple look</strong>. I would use bigger titles, more spacing between sections, get rid of the carousel. I would also take  the pictures myself to get a better quality and, knowing where they would go, be more pertinent.</p>
                <p class="to-fill">In hindsight, a part that I would completely redo is my API. Not knowing much about those at the time, it was a big mess. It did not follow any conventions. Since then I learned about <strong>REST</strong> and do my best to apply its rules and principles.</p>
