                "At the beginning <strong>Bokida</strong> was a student project, seeing the potential of the concept we decided to keep working on it and release it as a full length game.",
                "I worked on it for its whole duration, 4 years and 6 months, from the concept to the release. Because of the way we worked and communicated, I have been able to experience every aspect of the development, the production side as well as the administration and community management side.",
                "We had weekly meetings with the whole team to keep everyone informed on the tasks of each and collect feedbacks, opinions and to make collegial decisions. We also had daily meetings with people with whom we worked on the same feature.",

                "Playtests",
                "When we entered the beta stage, I managed the playstests. We recruited most of our candidates through social media. Our goal was to get has many constructive feedbacks as possible.",
                "To do so I chose to use a discord server to gather and discuss with the playtesters. This way I was able to discuss directly with them and get more details on their experience. Having a common and instantaneous plateform allowed them to discuss, share and compare their experience, thus creating retention and will to participate. I then collected and summarized their feedbacks to advise the rest of the team on how to improve the game.",
                "Level Design",
                "I was also in charge of the level design of several interactive zones. I worked closely with the lead designer, we had an iterative process that allowed us to test our ideas quickly. This meant that I had to built my levels carefully to be able to work on one part without having to change the ones approved.",
                "I also helped the programmers with the integration part, following their guidelines, nomenclature and testing my builds on my side.",
                "Test QA",
                "Through out the second half of the project I did QA test. I set up the bug tracker and managed it, checking and validating corrected bugs, reporting the ones I found and rewriting or detailing the ones other members found when needed.",
                "We sorted the bugs by priority and type so everyone knew which bug concerned them and which one they should correct first.",
                "What I Learned",
                "I had to do tasks for which I had no experience or little training and had to learn on the job (such as coordinating playtest, 3D animation and 3D modeling). I dreaded doing those as I wasn’t sure I would be able to deliver satisfying and usable results. My approach was to set achievable goals and aim futher each iteration (doing pertinent research and tutorial to improve), this way I was able to develop new skills and reach satisfying results. I am now much less apprehensive about getting into tasks that seem beyond my current skill.",
                "I’ve seen a whole digital project development cycle, and quite a long one. A big challenge was to stay motivated through the whole duration of the project. I had to learn how to discipline myself and stay focused instead of being motivated. I never worked on a project longer than a few months before Bokida and never met the limit of my motivation to work on a project. This might be the most usefull skill a learned.",
                "What I Would Do Differently",
                "I would do a more rigorous tasks tracking through production documents or tools like SCRUM with trello. We have lost a lot of time repeating or forgetting tasks said oraly during a meeting. We should have set up a tool to keep track of everyone’s tasks. I should have done it more rigourisly on my side too.",
                "Better time management on my side. Working at home it is hard to discern free time and work time. When you do not work you can feel guilty for not working. I tried to put some fixed working period during the day but working with people in different time zone, it was not always possible to respect those periods. I should have taken a more flexible approach, setting a work duration per day and tracking it to better manage my work time and my free time.",

                "My goal was to create a one page web site with everything available easily and a clean look. My biggest constraint was my technical skills that I tried to turn to my advantage. I used a simple layout with tabs organized by section. The most important part was the « Menu » section where the user could find the lunch formula, the dishes, suggestions and the wines. Each of thoses sub section has a different layout.",
                "Admin Side",

                "What I Learned",
                "It was a good training and a formative way to apply the theory I learned prior to this project. Before it, I just did some exercises and had never developed a full website. As a beginner I fell in most beginners traps such as web browers compatibility, special characters in SQL requests, character encoding and more. Those are types of mistakes that I am now able to anticipate and identify.",
                "My favorite part of the website is the admin side as it is where there are the most interactions. I tried to make it as usable as my programming skills allowed. Adding feedbacks when updating content, automatically fillind text fields from the database, instantly adding or deleting text fields. I also created a delayed update that allowed the client to update his menu at a later date. Sadly I was not able to implement it as the client’s server did not allow « on schedule » requests.",
                "A challenging part of the project was the communication with the client. It was not always easy to get a clear answer and find exactly what he wanted (not being sure himself). To ease the communication I tried to explain my design choices with anotated mock ups and made several suggestions for each iteration.",
                "What I Would Do Differently",
                "I would use a framework or a library to simplify server requests and compatibility issues such as Angular, React or Vue. I really enjoy coding with JS and in the future I would like to learn more tools using this language.",
                "On the design side I would now go for a bolder design while keeping the clean and simple look. I would use bigger titles, more spacing between sections, get rid of the carousel. I would also take  the pictures myself to get a better quality and, knowing where they would go, be more pertinent.",
                "For my next web project I would use prototyping software better suited for web design than Illustrator such as Axure RP, Pencil or InVision. Illustrator is good to test different layouts rapidly but offers no features to test navigation and interactivity.",

We ended the 6 months with a polishable game but enjoyable nonetheless. We were able to get all the core feature we wanted but still had room to enrich them (add more power ups for example).

For example, our main feature went from a simple walk and dash to a walk, lock and dash to a simple lock and dash.

I took a liking in this method as it is easy to set up and less stressful than a more linear method.",

Prior to Tanuki No Tama I spent a lot of time planning and thinking about a feature instead of prototyping it and have a concrete base to work on. I was afraid to lose time developing it and wanted to anticipate and plan every detail beforehand. But I ended up still having to spend time tweaking and modifying my feature after developing it.
