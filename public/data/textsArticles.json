                "I come from a <strong>game design</strong> training, this discipline draws on many others such as ergonomics, cognitive science, architecture and social sciences (sociology, anthropology, …). Through the prism of game design I extended my knowledge and got interested in other areas, including <strong>web design</strong> and <strong>programming</strong>. The latter attracts me by its rational side which resonate with the way I think. I find in programming what I like in design, <strong>looking for efficiency through simplicity</strong> without the abstract aspect inherent in design. In my eyes, <strong>Programming is more hands on than design while keeping the creative aspect</strong>.",

I also created a delayed update that allowed the client to update his menu at a later date. Sadly I was not able to implement it as the client’s server did not allow « on schedule » requests.",

We ended the 6 months with a polishable game but enjoyable nonetheless. We were able to get <strong>all the core features</strong> we wanted but still had room to enrich them (add more power ups for example).

Prior to Tanuki No Tama I spent a lot of time planning and thinking about a feature instead of prototyping it and have a concrete base to work on. I was afraid to lose time developing it and wanted to anticipate and plan every detail beforehand. But I ended up still having to spend time tweaking and modifying my feature after developing it.
